Region Finder

I was not too sure if Countries and Regions were the same thing. I assumed in this case that they were. Region codes = Country code.

This is a tool which creates N regions.
Will also generate M phone numbers

Review

	The main challenges were due to the M1 chip on my mac. Several services didnt work. I was unable to host the database locally. I have therefore setup a database on azure. I downloaded this as a bacpac file and copied this to data folder.
	The credentials for the server are in the config file. I would usually not include this (e.g source control) but I created the server exclusively for this test. I can open it up to your ip address if required.
	The algorithm itself was a simple loop to compare the regions in DB to the start of the phone number.
